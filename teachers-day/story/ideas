Maybe Mr Ong and his jokes
another joke could be the one abot an neutron and proton going to a coffeshop? if you remember that one? 
then the shopowner collected money from the protron but gave the coffee to the neutron for free because he had "no charge"

you can also write about how n2 mr ong is in classes :P
and how he makes our bren saturated :)
you can also write about him bobbing to kahoot HAAH
and another one can also be because we are have mass and occupy space so we matter
ohh and one where water is selfish 我的
